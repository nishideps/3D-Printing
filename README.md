# 3D Printing and Archaelogy in the Baltic Sea

The files contained in this repository include the background work towards finding out how accurate different modelling softwares are for estimating the weight of a 3D printed object. It looks at a large dataset consisting of information about the 3D printed objects including their weight, colour and the material used. 

There is a second project focused on a gravesite in Gotland, in the field outside the walls of Visby, a total of 493 femurs were found. The femurs consisted of 256 left femurs and 237 right femurs which means that at least 256 people must have been buried there but the aim was to work out how many people were actually buried there using statistical modelling.

Methods implemented for statistical anlysis include, but are not limited to:
- Confidence intervals
- Bayesian estimation
- Importance sampling
- Leave-one-out cross-validation
- Monte Carlo estimate
- p-testing

This project is programmed using R.
